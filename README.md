The present repository consists in a small personal project about soccer. The main pourpose of this project was to learn how to use APIs and to keep me in exercise with React. I combined my exigence of learning with my passion on soccer and Italian Championship.

As told before, React was used to design this project. In some parts, StyleComponents was used to style whyle in other cases normal CSS files were used. As API font, football-data.org was used. Finally, in order to pass from a page to another one, React Router was used.

The main files hierarchy is described hereafter: [App.js (Father)] > [ScheduledMatchs.js, SerieATable.js (Children)] In particular, in App.js there are all the API requests, which informations are passed from father to children through props.

The following instructions are useful if you will get a copy of the project and run on your local machine.

Installing Commands in console: React installing: npm install StyledComponents installing: npm install --save styled-components

Running Commands in console: Running: npm start; Stopping: Contr+C
