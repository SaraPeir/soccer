The present repository consists in a small personal project about soccer. The main pourpose of this project was to learn how to use APIs and to keep me in exercise with React. I combined my exigence of learning with my passion on soccer and Italian championship.

As told before, React was used to design this project. In any parts, in order to style the pages, StyleComponents was used whyle in other cases normal CSS files where used. As API font, football-data.org was used. Finally, in order to pass from a page to another one, React Router was used.

The main files hierarchy is described hereafter:
App.js (Father) > ScheduledMatchs.js, SerieATable.js (Children)
In particular, in App.js there are all the API request, which informations will pass from father to children through props.
